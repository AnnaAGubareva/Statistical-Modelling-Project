# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
To build statistical model with Python, utilizing data collected though an API

## Process
### step 1: Collect data through API from CityBikes, Yelp and FourSquare websites
### step 2: Retrieve collected data from json files and organize it into pandas data frame
### step 3: Explore the data using data visualization
### step 4: Building regression model in Python

## Results
Yelp AIP is oriented more on customer reviews, when FourSquare oriented more on “check-ins” points.
This also was represented by the data collected in json files.
FoourSquare gave more information about business ( category, address, location and etc), 
when Yelp focus more on such things as customer reviews, review count, and even events.

I was aiming to fund medium-to strong correlation between citi bikes availability and distance to the center of touristic city Lyon, France. 
However, according to the model which I built, there is no strong correlation between both these variables.

## Challenges 
Extracting data from json files and building data frame.
Working with columns and data validation before model is build

## Future Goals
To spend more time to build more reliable model with strong correlation between variables
